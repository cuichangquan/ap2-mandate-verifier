# AP2 Mandate Verifier for Ruby

> **Status: research only — no Ruby verifier, released Gem, production security assurance, or AP2 conformance claim yet.**

## Why?

A future personal AI could arrive at a web service carrying evidence of authority granted by a person, without that person pre-configuring every service. **A self-declared permission is not proof of authority.** The service needs verifiable evidence, an explicit trust policy, and its own final authorization decision.

This project explores **AP2 v0.2 Checkout Mandate verification in Ruby**, initially on the merchant/verifier side, to see whether a small reusable Ruby Gem is justified.

                                            v
                                        Ruby service

                                            |
                         verified evidence / verification failure
                                            |
                         Service's own authorization and controls
                                            |
                                   Business action or STOP
```

A valid digital signature does **not** by itself establish that this Agent is authorized for this specific user, operation, merchant, price, or moment.

## Proposed initial scope

- Study AP2 **v0.2** Agent Authorization and Checkout Mandate; do not mix in the earlier v0.1 model.
- Explore cryptographic verification, trusted issuer/keys, holder/Agent binding, transaction binding, Open/Closed mandate constraints, audience, time, and failure cases.
- Compare behavior and test vectors with the official AP2 Python implementation before claiming interoperability.
- Expose verified evidence to the **host**; do not replace the host's authorization or payment controls.
- Start with a design and security review. No Gem implementation has been approved yet.

## Explicit non-goals

- Building a wallet, user credential issuer, payment processor, trusted consent UI, Personal AI, MCP server, or A2A transport.
- Supporting all AP2 flows or production payments in the first iteration.
- Assuming all unknown issuers or self-asserted permissions are trustworthy.
- Changing ActingFor Core, ActingFor Shopping Demo or a2a-rails.

## Relationship to other OSS

- [ActingFor](https://github.com/cuichangquan/acting_for): Rails-native delegated authorization using host-resolved identities and locally stored delegations.
- [a2a-rails](https://github.com/cuichangquan/a2a-rails): A2A protocol integration for Rails. It does not verify AP2 Mandates.

Both are **separate projects**. Integration comes after the verification contract is proven.
